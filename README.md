## Installation

You need to install `@fec/remark-responsive-images` with NPM or Yarn. Since this is a plugin for Remark, I assume you already have Remark installed and configured.

```shell
npm install @fec/remark-responsive-images
yarn add @fec/remark-responsive-images
```

## Configuration

You can use `@fec/remark-responsive-images` like any other Remark plugin:

```javascript
const remark = require('remark');
const images = require('@fec/remark-responsive-images');

const processor = remark().use(images);
```

`@fec/remark-responsive-images` gives you some options to customise its behaviour:

```javascript
const remark = require('remark');
const images = require('@fec/remark-responsive-images');

const processor = remark().use([[images, options]]);
```
